<h1 align="center">Dependency Injection Examples 👨🏽‍💻</h1>

<h3>Dependency injection for 5 years old</h3>
When you go and get things out of the refrigerator for yourself, you can cause problems. You might leave the door open, you might get something Mommy and Daddy doesn’t want you to have. You might even be looking for something we don’t even have or which has expired.
What you should be doing is stating a need: “I need something to drink with lunch”, and then we will make sure you have something when you sit down to eat.

Dependency Injection is where a needed dependency is injected by another object.
The class being injected has no responsibility in instantiating the object being injected.

<h3>Types of dependency Injection</h3>

- By setters - Area of much debate<br>
- By constructors - Most preferred :white_check_mark:
